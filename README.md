# tiny-invoice

This tool is currently a quick and dirty invoicing tool, written in
PHP. Expect a bumpy ride and some features which don't work at all.

## Installation

Installation is fairly straightforward.

  * Put the code somewhere on a webserver that supports .htaccess files
  * Use the database.sql file in the config/ directory to bootstrap the database
  * Make sure that tmp/ and store/ are writeable by your webserver user
  * Create config/Config.php from config/Config.sample.php

This should allow you to log in with the default credentials (user/user).

A non-exhaustive list of requirements:

  * PHP >= 5.4
  * php-mysql
  * php-gd
  * MySQL >= 5.1
